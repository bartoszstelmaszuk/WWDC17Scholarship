# WWDC17Scholarship
Winning application for WWDC17 scholarship from Apple.

This is a PlaygroundBook application to see it in full potential it needed to be run from iPad. Playground in the repo is only for develop purposes.

Main idea is to ask questions about the author of the code and the character on the painting will answer. Some answers have "extended" version with additional pictures.
